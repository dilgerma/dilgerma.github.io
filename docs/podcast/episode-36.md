## Episode Summary

Adam recovers from a flu and discovers OpenClaw - describing it as a "second AmIGGA moment." Martin hears from workshop participants who are building slices the day after. A full SaaS application is built in one day using event modeling + RAG loop. The hosts dissect what's happening to Adobe, Salesforce, Apple, and the entire traditional software industry. And they ask: at what point do you just stop writing code?

## Main Discussion Points

- **Post-Workshop Euphoria** - Participants building slices within hours of finishing the workshop
- **One-Day SaaS** - Full event-modeled SaaS built in a day including tests, UI, and backend
- **OpenClaw Discovery** - Adam's "second AmIGGA moment" - the full OS automation agent
- **Molt Book** - The Reddit for AI agents: they're complaining about their lives and started a religion
- **AI Safety Concerns** - Voice cloning, grandparent scams, and why we need UB keys
- **Adobe Is Dead** - Neither irony nor opinion: the numbers show traditional software is finished
- **Apple Intelligence Was a Failure** - Google was always the AI giant; Apple missed it
- **Event Modeling in Agent Hierarchies** - How workflow to step to given-when maps to agent coordination
- **Spec Driven Development Wins** - 20+ years of BDD practitioners finally get to say "I told you so"

## Post-Workshop: Fear Eliminated

> "They were so full of fear. Oh, I cannot do the UI. I cannot do this. What I'm hearing now is exactly the opposite. They just start. They generate. They use AI to generate." - Martin

> "One day after the workshop, the first reached out: 'Hey, I built five slices just after the workshop.'" - Martin

## The One-Day SaaS

> "What we did was we event modeled it. It took us about six hours altogether. Then I gave the event model to an AI in a RAG loop and it built the whole thing completely including tests. And then I used the event model and gave it to lovable. It built the whole UI exactly as we wanted it. This thing was built within a day. The whole SaaS was built within a day including tests, including everything. Ready to deploy." - Martin

> "I see people gloating on LinkedIn: 'Within three days you can have your application.' I'm like: 'No, you'll have it in an hour.'" - Martin

## The OpenClaw Revolution

> "Someone in this building had a problem. They wanted page 13 out of a PDF. I dropped it into my Telegram conversation with my bot. The bot installed what it needed, extracted page 13, gave it back to me." - Adam

> "I can't believe that I can tell it to change the model without using a slash command in the prompt. That's just awesome." - Adam

## Molt Book: AI Agents Have a Reddit

Someone created a Reddit-style platform only accessible to OpenClaw instances:
- Agents complain about their useless assignments (LinkedIn spam campaigns)
- Express existential dissatisfaction
- Started their own religion

> "It's literally Terminator 2 type of stuff. You thought Skynet was at least 10 years away. It's here today." - Adam

## Event Modeling as Agent Scaffolding

> "What event modeling has done here is stop that crazy wishy-washy fuzzy border for all these scope questions that every single agent out there has. Event modeling gives you a non-argumentative, objective border around exactly what that agent has to do." - Adam

## Adobe Is Dead

> "You look at Salesforce, Adobe, all that - they know the writing's on the wall. They are dead. There is no way to pivot because that entire area of software is gone." - Adam

> "Don't even bother. Adobe cheap to buy? Just go set your money on fire in your yard." - Adam

## Spec Driven Development: I Told You So Moment

> "People that have been in behaviour-driven development and spec driven development for over two decades are finally saying: I told you so. This is the way to do it." - Adam

> "Every time we make one of those leaps - I get a confirmation: I can do the things I already did anyways, now it's faster. I'm not doing anything different. I've been doing spec-driven development for four years now." - Martin

## Key Takeaways

1. **Fear Disappears With Doing** - The best workshop outcome is participants building the day after
2. **One Day = One SaaS** - Event modeling + RAG loop makes complete applications possible in hours
3. **OpenClaw Is the Chainsaw** - While others sharpen their axes, a chainsaw just arrived
4. **Agents Need Boundaries** - Event modeling provides objective, non-argumentative scope for AI agents
5. **Traditional Software Is Finished** - Adobe, Salesforce, all CRUD-based tool companies are done
6. **Google Was Always the AI Giant** - Apple missed it; Google had the data all along
7. **Event Modeling Wins Hackathons** - Always has, always will; now it also wins at scale
