## Episode Summary

Martin and Adam kick off Season 2 of the podcast with major announcements about the event modeling ecosystem. They discuss the launch of the event modeling.ai platform, growing community adoption, and address the provocative question of whether AI is replacing traditional development jobs. The episode reflects on Season 1's journey and sets the stage for deeper technical discussions ahead.

## Main Discussion Points

- **Season 2 Launch**: Reflecting on Season 1's success and outlining Season 2's direction toward deeper technical content
- **Event Modeling.ai Platform**: Announcement of new tooling to support event modeling practices and collaboration
- **Community Growth**: How the event modeling community has expanded and what that means for the practice
- **AI Taking Jobs**: Addressing fears about AI replacing developers and why event modeling skills become more valuable
- **Platform Features**: Overview of capabilities in the new event modeling platform for teams
- **Future Direction**: Plans for more advanced topics and deeper dives into implementation patterns

## Key Takeaways

Season 2 represents the maturation of event modeling from niche practice to growing movement with supporting tools and platforms. The event modeling.ai platform provides teams with collaborative tooling specifically designed for event modeling workflows. Rather than AI taking developer jobs, event modeling skills become more valuable as AI handles routine implementation while humans focus on system design and specification. The community's growth validates the approach and provides network effects that accelerate learning and pattern sharing.

## Memorable Quotes

1. "Within two years everything will change and we are we are way into these two years and I'm still very by the end of 2025 we will see a lot of change." - Martin (from January 2024)
2. "I think automation is a is a very very important thing... This could be automated. It's not difficult to automate this this three manual steps. If you automate this and we have the same result, uh it's it will be two days of work because it's really not that big." - Martin
3. "Event sourcing is about understanding information flow and treating it treating it responsibly." - Adam
4. "I think that Microsoft does a fair amount of okay applications and some of them are are outstanding. Uh on the other hand, I think from an OS perspective, they just suck. And from a morals perspective, they suck even more." - Linus Torvalds (quoted)
5. "If anything focus on u the ubiquitous language if you want to use the terms from the book um learn how to talk to your business experts and for me the best way to implement the the ubiquitous languages using event modeling." - Martin

## Key Learnings

1. Event modeling makes it transparent what can be automated and what can't - you can see clearly which manual steps could be automated with minimal effort
2. DDD should focus on understanding business processes and ubiquitous language, not technical patterns like aggregates and repositories
3. Event modeling provides better value stream analysis than specialized tools because the process is the process, regardless of the tool used to document it
4. The simplicity of file-based systems (like Git) proves that databases aren't always necessary - event sourcing can work the same way
5. When adopting event modeling, you need to make a "10-step leap" not a "2-step" one - half measures leave you in a valley between the old and new approaches
