# Day 1: Setup

Time is short for all of us, each day should not take you more than 10 minutes worth of efforts.
But you'll hopefully learn some invaluable lessons along the way that took me more than 10 years to learn.

Since time is short, let's dive right in. Today we set the stage for the next 10 days.

## Welcome

Welcome to the first E-Mail of this 10 day E-Mail Course. You will learn everything necessary to build your own code generator in this course.

Watch the video here.

## Clone the Git Repository

Our playground for this course will be a git repository that you can directly clone.

## Install the Miro Toolkit

You will also need to install the Miro Toolkit for Eventmodeling

[https://miro.com/marketplace/eventmodeling/](https://miro.com/marketplace/eventmodeling/)

Make yourself familiar with the Toolkit and play a bit with it.

The Miro-Board we will use in this course is found here. Feel free to make your own copy of it.

## Prepare Docker Image

If you want to save some time tomorrow, download Docker Image already and run:

```bash
docker pull nebulit/codegen
```
