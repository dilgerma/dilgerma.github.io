# Day 2: Event Modeling Basics

Each day should not take you more than 10 - 15 minutes worth of efforts.

## Welcome

Welcome to the second day of this 10 day e-mail course. You will learn everything necessary to build your own code generator in this course.

The plan for today - learn some basics of Eventmodeling and play around with a first generated prototype.

## Videos

I have prepared 2 videos for you:

(Make sure to do the Eventmodeling Part first)

- **Video**: First steps in Eventmodeling
- **Video**: Play around with the Real Time Prototype (cool stuff)

(did you know that a full license of the Tooling comes attached with the "Implementing Eventsourcing" Course?)

If you have any questions or something does not work, feel free to contact me via LinkedIn or answer to this E-Mail.
