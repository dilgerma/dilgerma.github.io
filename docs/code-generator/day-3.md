# Day 3: JSON Structure

Each day should not take you more than 10-15 minutes worth of efforts.

## Welcome

Welcome to the third E-Mail of this 10 day e-mail course. You will learn everything necessary to build your own code generator in this course.

The plan for today - we will analyze the JSON structure which serves as a basis for our code generator.
And you will learn how to export the JSON Model from your Miro Board.

## Video Tutorial

You can follow along step by step with this video:

## JSON Structure Example

Here is a minimal example of what the JSON structure that gets exported from Miro looks like:

## Wrap Up

That's all for today. We use this JSON structure tomorrow to build our own first small code generator.

If you find some more time today - feel free to do some experiments with your Event Model in Miro.
Add some fields and check how they get encoded into the JSON structure.

See you tomorrow!
