    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Miro is an incredibly powerful platform for collaborative visual modeling, and when combined with the Event Modeling toolkit, it becomes an indispensable tool for designing event-driven systems. This guide will help you unlock the full potential of Miro for your event modeling workflows.</p>

    <h2>Keyboard Shortcuts</h2>
    <p>Master these keyboard shortcuts to dramatically increase your modeling speed:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><code>C</code> - Create a new card or sticky note</li>
      <li><code>L</code> - Draw a line or connector</li>
      <li><code>T</code> - Add text</li>
      <li><code>Ctrl/Cmd + D</code> - Duplicate selected items</li>
      <li><code>Ctrl/Cmd + G</code> - Group selected items</li>
      <li><code>Space + Drag</code> - Pan around the board</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Template Strategy</h2>
    <p>Creating and using templates can save you hours of work:</p>

    <h3>Create Reusable Patterns</h3>
    <p>Identify common patterns in your event models and save them as templates. For example, create a standard "user authentication flow" template that includes login, password reset, and session management events.</p>

    <h3>Team Templates</h3>
    <p>Establish team-wide templates for consistency. This ensures everyone uses the same visual language and structure, making it easier for team members to understand each other's models.</p>

    <h2>Collaboration Features</h2>
    <p>Miro shines when it comes to real-time collaboration:</p>

    <h3>Live Cursors</h3>
    <p>See where your teammates are working in real-time. This helps avoid conflicts and enables natural collaboration patterns.</p>

    <h3>Comments and Mentions</h3>
    <p>Use the commenting feature to discuss specific parts of your model. Mention teammates with @ to get their attention on specific questions or decisions.</p>

    <h3>Voting and Feedback</h3>
    <p>Use Miro's voting feature to make decisions democratically during modeling sessions. This is particularly useful for resolving disagreements about system design.</p>

    <h2>Organization Tips</h2>
    <p>Keep your boards organized and easy to navigate:</p>

    <h3>Use Frames</h3>
    <p>Group related sections of your event model using frames. This makes it easy to navigate large models and present specific sections to stakeholders.</p>

    <h3>Color Coding</h3>
    <p>Develop a consistent color scheme for different types of elements. For example:
    <ul>
      <li>Blue for events</li>
      <li>Orange for commands</li>
      <li>Green for read models</li>
      <li>Yellow for external systems</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Layers and Tags</h3>
    <p>Use tags to mark items that need attention, decisions, or review. This helps during retrospectives and planning sessions.</p>

    <h2>Integration with Development Workflow</h2>
    <p>Connect your modeling work with your development process:</p>

    <h3>Export Options</h3>
    <p>Export your boards as PDFs for documentation or images for presentations. Miro also supports exporting specific frames, making it easy to share relevant sections.</p>

    <h3>Version Control</h3>
    <p>Create different versions of your board to track evolution over time. This is particularly useful when exploring different architectural approaches.</p>

    <h2>Advanced Features</h2>
    <p>Take advantage of Miro's advanced capabilities:</p>

    <h3>Custom Shapes</h3>
    <p>Create custom shapes for specialized needs in your domain. This can help make your models more intuitive for domain experts.</p>

    <h3>Smart Connections</h3>
    <p>Use smart connection features to automatically maintain relationships between elements as you reorganize your board.</p>

    <h2>Performance Tips</h2>
    <p>Keep your boards running smoothly:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Break large models into multiple boards linked together</li>
      <li>Use Miro's presentation mode for stakeholder reviews</li>
      <li>Regularly archive old versions to keep your workspace clean</li>
      <li>Optimize images before adding them to your boards</li>
    </ul>
