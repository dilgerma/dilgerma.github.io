    <h2>The AI Revolution in Event Modeling</h2>
    <p>Artificial intelligence is transforming how we approach event modeling. The Miro Event Modeling Toolkit integrates AI capabilities to help you create better models faster, validate your designs, and generate insights that might otherwise be missed.</p>

    <h2>AI-Assisted Model Creation</h2>
    <p>Creating event models from scratch can be time-consuming. Our AI integration helps accelerate this process:</p>

    <h3>Natural Language to Events</h3>
    <p>Describe your system in plain English, and the AI will suggest events, commands, and read models. For example, you can type "A user places an order for products and pays with a credit card" and receive a suggested event flow including OrderPlaced, PaymentProcessed, and InventoryReserved events.</p>

    <h3>Pattern Recognition</h3>
    <p>The AI recognizes common patterns in event-driven systems and suggests appropriate modeling approaches. It can identify CQRS patterns, saga patterns, and event sourcing opportunities in your descriptions.</p>

    <h2>Intelligent Validation</h2>
    <p>AI helps catch issues before they become problems:</p>

    <h3>Consistency Checking</h3>
    <p>The AI analyzes your event model for inconsistencies, such as:
    <ul>
      <li>Commands that don't produce events</li>
      <li>Events without corresponding read models</li>
      <li>Missing aggregate boundaries</li>
      <li>Circular dependencies</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Naming Conventions</h3>
    <p>Ensure your events and commands follow best practices with AI-powered naming suggestions. The system learns from industry standards and your team's preferences.</p>

    <h2>Context-Aware Suggestions</h2>
    <p>As you work, the AI provides contextual recommendations:</p>

    <h3>Domain-Specific Insights</h3>
    <p>For e-commerce systems, the AI might suggest common events like CartAbandoned, PriceAdjusted, or RefundIssued based on industry patterns.</p>

    <h3>Integration Points</h3>
    <p>The AI identifies potential integration points with external systems and suggests appropriate event choreography or orchestration patterns.</p>

    <h2>Code Generation Enhancement</h2>
    <p>AI takes code generation to the next level:</p>

    <h3>Intelligent Templates</h3>
    <p>Generate code that's not just syntactically correct but also follows best practices for your chosen framework and language. The AI understands context and generates production-ready code.</p>

    <h3>Test Generation</h3>
    <p>Automatically generate unit tests, integration tests, and even behavior-driven development (BDD) scenarios based on your event model.</p>

    <h2>Learning from Your Models</h2>
    <p>The AI continuously learns from your modeling patterns:</p>

    <h3>Team-Specific Patterns</h3>
    <p>Over time, the AI recognizes your team's preferred patterns and conventions, making increasingly relevant suggestions.</p>

    <h3>Historical Analysis</h3>
    <p>Compare current models with previous versions to identify evolution patterns and potential architectural drift.</p>

    <h2>Collaboration Assistance</h2>
    <p>AI helps facilitate better team collaboration:</p>

    <h3>Meeting Summaries</h3>
    <p>Automatically generate summaries of modeling sessions, including key decisions, open questions, and action items.</p>

    <h3>Documentation Generation</h3>
    <p>Create comprehensive documentation from your event models, including system overviews, sequence diagrams, and API specifications.</p>

    <h2>Getting Started with AI Features</h2>
    <p>To enable AI features in your Miro Event Modeling Toolkit:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Open your Miro board with the Event Modeling toolkit</li>
      <li>Click on the AI Assistant panel in the toolkit sidebar</li>
      <li>Connect your AI provider (OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, or custom endpoint)</li>
      <li>Start using AI-powered features in your modeling workflow</li>
    </ol>

    <div class="info-box">
      <p><strong>Privacy Note:</strong> All AI processing can be done with your own AI endpoints, ensuring your sensitive domain models never leave your infrastructure.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Best Practices</h2>
    <p>To get the most out of AI-powered modeling:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Review all AI suggestions critically - AI is a tool, not a replacement for domain expertise</li>
      <li>Provide feedback on suggestions to help the system learn</li>
      <li>Use AI as a collaborative partner, not a crutch</li>
      <li>Combine AI suggestions with team discussion and validation</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="success-box">
      <p><strong>Results:</strong> Teams using AI-assisted modeling report 50% faster model creation and 30% fewer design issues caught during implementation.</p>
