## What You'll Learn

Through this course, you'll master:

- Setting up the Event Modeling toolkit and code generator environment
- Understanding the JSON structure exported from Event Models
- Creating custom code generator templates
- Generating Events, Commands, and Command Handlers automatically
- Working with dependencies between model elements
- Building projections and read models from generated code
- Iterating on your code generator to fit your needs

## Prerequisites

To follow along with this course, you'll need:

- Git installed on your machine
- Docker (for running the code generator)
- A Miro account
- Basic knowledge of TypeScript/JavaScript
- An IDE or code editor (VS Code or IntelliJ recommended)
