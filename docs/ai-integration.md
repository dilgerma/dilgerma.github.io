## What AI Can Do

The Event Modeling Toolkit's AI integration helps you:

- **Understand Models**: Ask questions and get explanations of complex flows
- **Generate Documentation**: Create specs, API docs, and user guides automatically
- **Plan Projects**: Estimate timelines and effort based on model complexity
- **Create Models**: Build slices from natural language descriptions
- **Validate Models**: Check for consistency, completeness, and best practices
- **Suggest Improvements**: Get recommendations for better model structure
- **Add Attributes**: Let AI suggest appropriate data structures for your events

## Supported AI Providers

- **OpenAI**: GPT-4, GPT-3.5
- **Anthropic**: Claude 3 (Opus, Sonnet, Haiku)
- **Azure OpenAI**: Enterprise-grade AI services
- **Google**: Gemini Pro
- **Local Models**: Ollama, LM Studio

## Getting Started

1. **Configure AI Provider**
   - Open toolkit settings
   - Navigate to AI Integration
   - Enter your API key
   - Choose your preferred model

2. **Enable Features**
