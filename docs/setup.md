# Setting up the Miro Event Modeling Toolkit

Welcome to the Miro Event Modeling Toolkit setup guide. This page will walk you through the installation and initial configuration process.

## 🔒 Privacy First - Your Data Stays Yours

**The Miro Event Modeling Toolkit is built with Privacy First principles:**

- ✅ **No data is ever sent to any external system**
- ✅ **We will never use your Intellectual Property (because we never see it)**
- ✅ **No data ever leaves your Miro Board without you knowing ( for example by manually using our local running codegen container )**
- ✅ **No AI is used without you actively enabling it**
- ✅ **Only members on your Miro Team can access the data**

Your event models, business processes, and all board content remain completely private and secure within Miro.

Your event models, business processes, and all board content remain completely private and secure within Miro.
