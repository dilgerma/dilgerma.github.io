Welcome to the Miro Event Modeling Toolkit setup guide. This page will walk you through the installation and initial configuration process.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- A Miro account (free or paid)
- Access to the Miro board where you want to install the toolkit
- Administrator or edit permissions on the board

## Installation

### Step 1: Install from Miro Marketplace

1. Open your Miro board
2. Click on the **Apps** icon in the left sidebar
3. Search for "Event Modeling Toolkit"
4. Click **Install** to add the app to your board

[You can also directly install it from here](https://miro.com/marketplace/eventmodeling/)

### Step 2: Authorize the App

After installation, you'll need to authorize the app:

1. Click **Allow** when prompted to grant permissions
2. The app needs access to:
   - Read and write board content
   - Create and modify shapes
   - Access user information
3. Important to understand
   - The Miro Toolkit is built for Privacy First!
   - No data is ever sent to any other system
   - We will never use your Intellecutal property ( because we never see it )
   - No data leaves the Miro Board
   - No AI is used without you actively enabling it
   - Only Members on your Miro Team can access the data
