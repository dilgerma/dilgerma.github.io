# Jira Integration

Slices can be connected to Jira Tickets.

To do this, you first need to configure your Jira Base URL.

To do this, you need to create a Context Object.

![Screen Drawer]({{ '/assets/images/tutorial/jira/jira001.png' | relative_url }})

On the Context Object, you configure the Base-URL for your Jira Instance.

## Assigning a ticket to a slice

Select a Slice. 

The Slice needs to be assigned to a Context which has a Jira Base URL configured.

Now you can assign a Ticket.

![Screen Drawer]({{ '/assets/images/tutorial/jira/jira002.png' | relative_url }})

1) Make sure the Slice is assigned to a Context

2) Here you can reference the Ticket

3) The Link opens the Jira Ticket in a new Tab
