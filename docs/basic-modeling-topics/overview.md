## Interface Elements

1. **AI View** - On this tab, it enables the "Chat with your model" feature, which takes your existing Event Model, parses it and makes it available for your Chat Session. Speak to your Requirements.

2. **Annotations Toggle (Glasses Icon)** - Always enables annotations within the plugin. This will give you useful hints while you work. The fastest way to learn the tooling.

3. **Language Switcher** - Allows you to switch between german and english (spanish will follow).

4. **Overview Tab** - The current Tab "Overview" allows to view all contexts and also easily navigate between them. Also gives access to the Tree View, License Management (13), AI Token and Model-Configuration (14) and Details about your account (17).
