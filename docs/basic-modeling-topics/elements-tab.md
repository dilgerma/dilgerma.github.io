# Elements Tab

This tab allows you to quickly place new elements on the Board, either by clicking them or by dragging them onto the board.

## Basic Elements

![Elements Tab Interface](/assets/images/tutorial/03a.png)

1. **Screen Drawer** - This tool opens a popup and allows you to draw a screen.

2. **Empty Screen** - Place an empty Screen on the board.

3. **Processor** - Place a Processor on the board.

4. **Command** - Place a Command on the board.

5. **Event** - Place an Event on the board.

6. **Read Model** - Place a Read Model on the board.

7. **Context** - Place a Context. A Context is basically a "name" for a Model. All Slices get linked to a Context and this allows a grouping of slices.

8. **Read Model** - Place a Read Model on the board.

9. **Chapter** - Place a chapter on the board. You can edit the title directly.

10. **Slice** - Put a slice on the board. You can either put in an empty slice, or select arbitrary elements, and then click the slice-button. The slice will automatically wrap all selected elements.

11. **Swimlane** - Put a Swimlane on the Board. Swimlanes can be used to group Events and Actors.

12. **Convert Elements** - Here you can convert "regular" elements to elements that can be used by the Miro Toolkit.

13. **Additional Elements** - Here you can place additional elements. There are many more elements. Most of them will be discussed in detail (see image 03b.png).

## Advanced Elements

More details about additional elements and their usage will be covered in the advanced modeling section.

## Quick Tips

- **Drag and Drop**: You can drag most elements directly onto the board instead of clicking.
- **Selection First**: Select elements first, then click the Slice button to automatically wrap them.
- **Context Grouping**: Use Contexts to organize related Slices for better model organization.
