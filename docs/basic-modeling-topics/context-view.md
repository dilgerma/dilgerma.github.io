# Context View

The Context View shows you a hierarchical view of all Contexts on the Board. Linked Contexts become sub-contexts, allowing you to build hierarchical context models on your board.

## Using the Context View

### Navigating the Hierarchy

**Expand/Collapse Contexts**
- Click on a context to expand or collapse its children
- See the full tree structure at a glance
- Focus on specific areas of interest

**Jump to Context**
- Click on any context to navigate to it on the board
- Quickly switch between different parts of your model
- Maintain spatial awareness of your location

### Creating Context Hierarchies

**Link Contexts**
1. Create multiple contexts on your board
2. Draw connections between parent and child contexts
3. The hierarchy automatically appears in Context View

## Troubleshooting

### Contexts Not Showing in Hierarchy
- Ensure contexts are properly linked on the board
- Check that connections are directional (parent → child)
- Refresh the Context View

### Circular Dependencies
- Avoid circular context references
- Restructure to create clear hierarchy
- Use events for bidirectional communication

### Too Many Levels
- Keep hierarchy depth reasonable (2-4 levels)
- Flatten if structure is too deep
- Combine contexts if appropriate
