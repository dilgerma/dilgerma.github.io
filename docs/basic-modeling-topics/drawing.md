# Drawing

Using the Screen Drawer allows you to quickly draw screens using a simple Drawing Tool.

![Screen Drawer]({{ '/assets/images/tutorial/elements_view/drawing/draw001.png' | relative_url }})

The tool used here is [TLDRAW](https://www.tldraw.com/).

My rule of thumb is simple - never use more than 2 minutes to draw a screen.
The screen in the image is perfectly fine. Typically you don´t need more details than shown here.

![Screen Drawer]({{ '/assets/images/tutorial/elements_view/drawing/draw002.png' | relative_url }})

1) Canvas

2) + 3) Drawing Tools

4) Fonz Size

5) When you are done, export your screen to  Miro

![Screen Drawer]({{ '/assets/images/tutorial/elements_view/drawing/draw003.png' | relative_url }})

The exported screen becomes an Image in Miro and can be used as a regular screen.
An exported Screen can be re-edited - ** but will always result in a new screen **

So an existing screen cannot be changed anymore.

## AI Drawing

You can use AI to draw screens.

![Screen Drawer]({{ '/assets/images/tutorial/elements_view/drawing/draw004.png' | relative_url }})

1) you can manually edit the configuration

2) Open the configuration in the Editor

![Screen Drawer]({{ '/assets/images/tutorial/elements_view/drawing/draw005.png' | relative_url }})

Die AI-generated Screen can be edited manually now.
