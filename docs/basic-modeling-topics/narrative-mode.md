# Narrative Mode

Narrative Mode is quite an interesting concept and allows you to leverage AI to translate your Event Model to natural language.

To use Narrative Mode, you always export a Configuration on the Code Tab.

![Narrative Mode]({{ '/assets/images/tutorial/narrative/narrative01.png' | relative_url }})

After exporting the Configuration, you can switch to [AI Mode](ai-overview) ( if AI is enabled )

Here you´ll see the "Analyze" Button.

![Narrative Mode]({{ '/assets/images/tutorial/narrative/narrative02.png' | relative_url }})

In Narrative Mode, you can switch between "Play Mode" and "Full View"

![Narrative Mode]({{ '/assets/images/tutorial/narrative/narrative03.png' | relative_url }})


## Full View

In Full View, you see the whole "Story" of the system.

![Narrative Mode]({{ '/assets/images/tutorial/narrative/narrative04.png' | relative_url }})

1) Identified Journey

2) Someone is changing the system

3) Policies and rules that apply

4) Someone or something is using existing information

5) Next Journey


## Play Mode

In Play-Mode you can step through the "narrative" of the system step by step. You only see one step at a time.
Basically playing through the story.

![Narrative Mode]({{ '/assets/images/tutorial/narrative/narrative05.png' | relative_url }})

1) Restart the Narrative

2) Previous Step

3) Next Step

4) Select a Journey

5) Current Step

I use the Narrative Mode to step through the system with the stakeholders just to see if the story makes sense.
