# Spec View

Use this View to define Given / When / Thens in the Scenario Editor.
You need to select a slice first.

![Spec View]({{ '/assets/images/tutorial/spec_view/500.png' | relative_url }})

**Key Features:**

1. **Slice Title**
2. **[Select Given / When / Then and then just select the elements in the model]({{ '/assets/images/tutorial/spec_view/501.png' | relative_url }})**
3. **Provide an additional description** for the test cases, business rules covered in the specification for example.

## Vertical Specifications

For Given / Thens ( Specifications for Read Models - leaving out the When Part ), you can also provide so-called Vertical Specifications.

![Vertical Specification]({{ '/assets/images/tutorial/spec_view/502.png' | relative_url }})

1. **Selected Event as GIVEN**
2. **Selected Read Model as THEN**
3. **Added Steps in the Vertical Specification**
4. **Apply the current Given / Then as new Vertical Specification Step**

## Example Data

After placing the Specification, you can select the elements and provide example data.

![Example Data]({{ '/assets/images/tutorial/spec_view/504.png' | relative_url }})
