# Manual editing

ATTENTION: Manuel Editing requires Opt-In. You need to activate it per configuration.

Select any Element and open the configuration. Activate "Sticky notes can be edited"

![Conversion View]({{ '/assets/images/tutorial/data_view/manual_edit/manual_edit00.png' | relative_url }})


the Miro Tooling allows you to edit Sticky Notes directly. 

![Conversion View]({{ '/assets/images/tutorial/data_view/manual_edit/manual_edit01.png' | relative_url }})

Make sure to have the Tooling open when you edit. 
You can also edit without any Tooling. The tooling will later check and mark Sticky Notes as edited.

Whenever you edit Sticky Notes directly, they will be marked red. 

![Conversion View]({{ '/assets/images/tutorial/data_view/manual_edit/manual_edit02.png' | relative_url }})

You will get a hint on the data view, that the sticky note differs from the stored data.

![Conversion View]({{ '/assets/images/tutorial/data_view/manual_edit/manual_edit03.png' | relative_url }})

You can now "Apply" - apply the data from the sticky note.

Or "Discard" - which means take the Data stored in Miro and remove all manual edits from the Sticky Note.
