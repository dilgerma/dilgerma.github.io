# Slice based forecasting

Based on the existing Event Model, we can start to make some forecasts about the current Progress.

For this you can use the integrated Slice-Based Forecasting. 

Just export a Configuration on the Code Tab

![Screen Drawer]({{ '/assets/images/tutorial/forecast/forecast001.png' | relative_url }})

In this case you see an export of an App consisting of 99 Slices and about 1 Million Lines of JSON config.

1) Use this button to jump to Slice Forecasting. Attention - here you are posting your Configuraton to an external system. This is a stateless Web-App, nothing is stored or logged. Still I want you to be aware.

Here you see a Report of your current progress.

![Screen Drawer]({{ '/assets/images/tutorial/forecast/forecast002.png' | relative_url }})

The Report is calculated based on the Model. 

1) Number of "Done" Slices

2) Number of Open Slices

3) This Project is 76% Done

4) Slice Status Distribution ( how many slices are in which status )
