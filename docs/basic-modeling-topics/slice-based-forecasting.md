# Slice based forecasting

Based on the existing Event Model, we can start to make some forecasts about the current Progress.

For this you can use the integrated Slice-Based Forecasting. 

Just export a Configuration on the Code Tab

![Screen Drawer]({{ '/assets/images/tutorial/forecast/forecast001.png' | relative_url }})

In this case you see an export of an App consisting of 99 Slices and about 1 Million Lines of JSON config.
