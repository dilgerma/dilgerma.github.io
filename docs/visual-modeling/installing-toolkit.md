3. The toolkit panel will open on the right side of your board

## Toolkit Components

After installation, you'll have access to:

### Sticky Note Templates
- **Command** stickies (blue) - User actions and system commands
- **Event** stickies (orange) - Things that happened in the system
- **View** stickies (green) - Data representations and read models

### Model Elements

- **Template boards** - Pre-configured example models

## Configuration

### Setting Up Your First Board

1. Create a new board or open an existing one
2. Launch the Event Modeling Toolkit
3. Use the template option to start with a sample structure:
   - Click **Templates** in the toolkit panel
   - Select "Basic Event Model Template"
   - Click **Create** to generate the template on your board

### Customizing Colors (Optional)

While the default colors follow Event Modeling conventions, you can customize them:

<div class="info-box">
<strong>Best Practice:</strong> Stick with the conventional colors (blue for commands, orange for events, green for views) to maintain consistency across your organization.
</div>

To verify your installation:
