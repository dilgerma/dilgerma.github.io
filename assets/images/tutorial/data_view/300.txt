## Data View

This View allows you to adjust the schema for each element.
Provide fields, change namings, types and more.
This screen adjusts for each element type.

1) Expert Mode - allows you to directly edit the JSON of the Element
2) [Documentation](304.png) allows you to provide additional information and also see all dependencies directly
3) [Settings](303.png) allows you to adjust the settings for displaying information on the sticky notes
4) Re-Validate data - whenever an arrow shows red, revalidate makes sure, all data is up to date ( happens automatically most of the time, but sometimes, manual revalidation is necessary )
5) Save element
6) Adds an "aggregateId" field to the element
7) Syncs all copies on the board. If you have duplicated elements, this makes sure, all copies have the same data.
8) Opens the configuration in a pop up window for easier editing.
