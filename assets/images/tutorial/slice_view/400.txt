## Slice View

This View only shows something if you select a slice.

You can create slices by selecting the elements that should belong to a slice and clicking (5)
This will draw a border around these elements. Whatever is inside the border belongs to the slice.

1) Move selected elements left, right, up, down
2) Increase the slice size vertically
3) Select all slices to the right ( have to be assigned to a Context )
4) Select the slice and all elements within ( including Specifications )
5) Draw a Slice around selected elements ( or empty if none selected )
6) Create a new slice based on the selected one ( if a State View is selected, models a State Change and vice versa )
7) Name of the slice - has to start with "slice:" ( will be added automatically if missing )
8) Slice Status
9) Allows to assign a context to the slice. You can select all slices and assign the context to all in one go.
10) Define Status as Border ( if unchecked, the whole slices is colored )
