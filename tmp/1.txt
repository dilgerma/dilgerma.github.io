Time is short for all of us, each day should not take you more than 10 minutes worth of efforts.
But you´ll hopefully learn some invaluable lessons along the way that took me more than 10 years to learn.
Since time is short, let´s dive right in. Today we set the stage for the next 10 days.
Day 1
Welcome to the first E-Mail of this 10 day E-Mail Course. You will learn everything necessary to build your own code generator in this course.

Clone the Git Repository
Our playground for this course will be a git repository that you can directly clone.
