Typically we try to keep the efforts at 5-10 Minutes. 
You´ll find complete implementation for day 6 in the git-repo on the branch "day-6"

Day 6
Yesterday we generated our Commands and Events from the config.json.
Let´s generate some Command Handlers today!
In the terminal, switch to your checked out repository
Make sure to run "npm install" 
Start the application using "npm run dev"
The application is accessible in the browser on "localhost:3000"

In the "templates" folder, you will find a new simple template in the file "QuizApi.ts.tpl"

Today we will configure a code generator that can generates command handlers.
In the index.js, you will find the new function "generateCommandHandlers"
generateCommandHandlers(){
   // provide the implementation here
}
Goal is to generate a Command Handler for each command.
They should look like this:
function handleCreateQuiz(command: CreateQuizCommand) {
  return []
}
Don´t worry, we will generate the applied Events directly tomorrow.
Follow these instructions:
1) find all commands
let commands = config.slices.flatMap(slice => slice.commands)


2) iterate over all commands
let commandHandlers = commands.map(command => {
 ` // logic to create command handlers
})


3) Implement the generator for command handlers and imports
let commandImports = commands.map(command => {
      let commandTitle = slugify(command.title, "")
      return `import {${commandTitle}} from "@/app/api/commands/${commandTitle}";`
}).join("\n")

let commandHandlers = commands.map(command => {
     let commandTitle = slugify(command.title, "")
     return `
         let handle${commandTitle} = (command: ${commandTitle}): Event[] => {
              return []
         }
}).join("\n");
The logic here is very simple. Iterate over all commands, generate the command title using "slugify".
This will change something like "Create Quiz" to "CreateQuiz"
This generates a prerendered String, that we apply to a template. I typically do not use the template
functionalities, but I generate them in Code.
this.fs.copyTpl(
     this.templatePath(`src/components/QuizApi.ts.tpl`),
     this.destinationPath(`./app/api/QuizApi.ts`),
     {
          commandImports: commandImports,
          createQuizCommandHandler: commandHandlers
      }
)


We now have generated all Command Handlers.

Run the Code Generator
docker run -ti -p 3001:3000 -v $PWD:/workspace --name codegen --rm nebulit/codegen
Within the container, run 
gen .generator/app

Tomorrow we will generate and apply the correct result events.


See you tomorrow!
