Each day should not take you more than 10 - 15 minutes worth of efforts.
Day 2
Welcome to the second day of this 10 day e-mail course. You will learn everything necessary to build your own code generator in this course.
The plan for today - learn some basics of Eventmodeling and play around with a first generated prototype.
I have prepared 2 videos for you:
(Make sure to do the Eventmodeling Part first)
Video:​ First steps in Eventmodeling​
Video: ​Play around with the Real Time Prototype​ ( cool stuff )
( did you know that a full license of the Tooling comes attached with the​ "Implementing Eventsourcing" ​Course? )
If you have any questions or something does not work, feel free to contact me via ​LinkedIn​ or answer to this E-Mail.
