[Music] all right welcome back to the event modeling and event sourcing podcast with your hosts Martin and Adam hello Martin good to uh see you again it's been a while since we recorded same yes was very looking forward to this episode yeah so we had yeah of course so we had a quick catch up before for uh recording as always and uh really happy to hear that things are moving forward with a lot of clients and uh people calling you back for engagements and all that and I think Jake is also now finally started as well so um the community is thriving lots of activity around event modeling and event sourcing which is always uh good to see um yeah a lot of different tools being uh created out there I had a uh a stream live stream with on a so shout out to Sam and that project um really good to see the interest and the amount of tooling being built for for what we're all about so it really helps us uh the more people know about it the more people make tools for this uh the better off everyone is so I'm really happy how about how about you and interest interest is growing everywhere so I I see it really every day every day I get more requests more people asking questions so it it really comes from everywhere which is really amazing I love to see that I think a lot of it is is your book uh being out there I think that's a big component it's uh it's quite popular people do pass that around quite a bit so I think again all that effort was worth something Martin yeah absolutely and we we are closing in on 1,700 book wow which is really amazing never expected that number yeah I I stand by my prediction I think by the end of the year we going to be well past 4,000 I have no problem seeing this I think we're getting to the point where um we've stopped I mean if you've really watched we've stopped promoting the book at all I mean I haven't really I still say it like in in you know like this or something like that but I I haven't made a post about the book in like a a couple of months and it's still selling it's uh it's I think it's the point where people are now referring the book it's really out of our hands it's really standing on its own Merit so someone buys the book and they like it they're recommending it to to another team someone else in the industry and uh so so we're seeing organic growth it's no longer uh just the Inner Circle talking about event modeling and event sourcing promoting it it's really the general public out there understanding what this book is and and discovering this by themselves which is really exciting yeah yeah I'm I'm I'm really looking forward um I'm about to launch this online course for the book and um there yes there's also a lot of interest so um we really trying to put out a lot of resources that can just help I think that pairing of the book plus plus the course um that that goes with it is going to be really really good and then plus with the specific workshops that interactivity um and then of course the private workshops that you know each of us does like we have our own with our clients and Etc and Jake's going to have his own that's also another good thing so um I think we talked about last time there's a really good um you know uh range of uh of places where someone can can get started they can start by reading the article watching some some things listening to this podcast experimenting a little bit on their own but as their interest grows they have another place to go they can take a workshop a paid Workshop they can take the course along with the book they can you know involve their company or their own project uh with uh us you know you me Jake uh Chris all these people that are that have um event sourcing companies along with event modeling um so as as more and more companies grow uh their businesses you know all of these things that course and workshops will just continue to grow so really exciting times yeah there's kind of this this clear road map where you can start and you can just decide on yourself how far do you want to go which is really I think this is really neat and this really helps just by starting and reading the book is is a good starting point and then you can just decide on yourself how to move on which is really I think it's the right way to do it yeah and I think the book is really important because uh yes you can Google a lot of articles but because the concept of event sourcing um less so vent moding as it is more recent but there's a lot of outdated information there's I'm I'm not that happy with the fact that the earliest Publications on event sourcing are the ones that are the most popular um simply because of who it was that said it it was Martin Fowler and it was set a long time so there's a lot of SEO that went out um to popularize that article which means that U anyone that's looking for information about this is really stuck in starting from from the initial kind of Concepts and ideas about how to how to approach this and I think that that's a uh a a problem with people needing to then go repeat the mistakes because they're starting from that old spot so the book is really an amazing thing that happened because it puts a line in the sand that you know at this point in time it's 2024 2025 this is um the way that's the most up to date of of working with event modeling and event sourcing so I think that's really important and the fact that it took off in sales as it did uh initially says a lot and and I'm hoping that uh we continue to see people start from what we know about event sourcing and event modeling you know in 2024 and 2025 yeah rather than going back to to 2010 and uh 2005 and all these old old articles that uh they're still good I mean at least they introduced this but there's so many devil in the the details when you're actually doing this at scale for many projects and of course at adaptech we've only done this way for the last 10 years September will be our 10 year anniversary this year amazing yeah that'll be the I can't believe it how time flies but it's it's you know a decade of only doing event sourcing and so when I say that this doesn't work or I prefer this way it's based on a lot of feedback from you know how how our contracts went how the projects went yeah and uh you know some some real eye-opening things from from that 10-year Journey so and of course yeah you yourself have switched that way Jake has switched 100% to this way Chris condrin has always worked this way he's now doing more of this uh um Consulting on his own but he also has you know decade plus experience like personally me and Chris have probably you know 15 years because we didn't incorporate right away I Incorporated once I was maybe seven years into event sourcing only um so I personally know that I wouldn't want to do anything other than event sourcing but then I needed to prove it to myself that you know I need a whole team I want this to actually scale so can I run a whole company doing things only this way and the answer is yes and even more so because those people that came they also see the you know they came to work with us they also see that they don't want to work any other way um so we've pretty much had no turnover whatsoever the initial people that worked with me are still here um no one has any plans on going anywhere so uh that says a lot because uh over the last two decades turnover is a big problem in it and we saw none none of that um arise for us and simply by having a a good approach a fair approach removing bias and all these things that we discuss on this podcast really makes people want to stay so um anyway I just yeah it's kind of fun to talk about all these things as I approach the 10y year anniversary of the company still hard to believe but uh I don't think there are many companies around who can say we did only event sourcing for a decade it's really really impressive yeah exactly and that's what I wanted there's a lot of people there that'll say oh no we can do event sourcing but that's not their specialty and I think we touched on it on the last episode is that you want experts and experts show you how good they are by what their dedication level is to something so if you're saying well you know we did a few projects on event sourcing that is a different level of expert than we've only been doing event sourcing we've only been helping you know event sourcing projects that maybe ran into trouble and we had to come in and uh and and rescue them and a lot of times people don't realize that it's event sourcing plus event modeling a lot of what we do really depends on event modeling to the point that in order to enable an event sourcing project event modeling is a requirement for us like we cannot really start with without having an event model there's a very few times that we've done anything maybe just infrastructure work for event sourcing but if there's you know features that are going to be shipped to users I want that diagram behind me filled out yeah we know who's working on what to be honest I I wouldn't dare to start an event sourcing Project without event modeling so uh I wouldn't do it makes total sense yeah well that's a it's a good side topic that we have so we have a few topics um this week uh let's let's do some announcements uh so we have um we're pushing back the uh Workshop to March 27th that's going to be the introductory um workshop and if you're already um well versed or at least know a bit about event sourcing and event modeling and you want to take the advanced one that's going to be um April 3rd and that one for the advanced uh for the advanced topics we're going to limit the amount of people that can uh uh go but that doesn't mean that it's uh we don't want to have this scarcity thing this is not a this is not a sales tactic um if it fills out um there'll be another one a week later so if you if you missed out on on April 3D and it fills out um then we'll have an April 10th and uh we'll do the same thing we'll start to fill that up and you know hopefully uh by keeping it down to uh a low number of people like 10 um we'll be able to give you a lot more attention for all the nitty-gritty details we can jump jump into some implementation specific questions that have more to do with your own problems internally so I think it's a great idea right Martin to have a small abely absolutely I would I would really join if I were not me I would join so it's I mean the the last Workshop we had was kind of the the advanced version already although it was scheduled as the basic workshop and the the discussions we had in this Workshop were really amazing still I still remember these discussions they were just amazing yeah it's uh it's we we also learn from this right so there's things that I forget that something was important I'm like oh yeah this person is struggling with this we should probably bring this up so even though I might know a concept I really don't talk about it anymore because maybe we've eliminated it for S like in in the way we work but then that those questions from participants really say okay right yeah the regular people that are just starting on this they may have these these things they run into so let's go back and do that so yeah this feedback loop with the community through these workshops because they start to really dig into uh the the problems that people are having um in their organizations um it gets to you know realistic scenarios and all that because we can make all sorts of fun projects that are you know uh hello world equivalents for for event sourcing but um the real learning happens when you're when you're applying this together with experts you know on on on what you have so that's a real good start to really feel that experience of working with experts and and and have your issues resolved um in the advanced version so again that's a March 27th for the beginner intro type of uh work we can send entire teams there's really not going to be much I mean unless it gets ridiculous we're probably going to you know have as many people as want to join that Workshop but if we're going to get over 50 or something we're going to probably add a second date pretty quick that would not be a problem but I think I'm really looking forward to both of these workshops so the beginner Workshop will kind of be a guided introduction uh with exercises and I think the advanced Workshop will really be diving into some real world problems which which will both be very very interesting so I'm really looking forward to both of them yeah I'm excited too I I get you know I try to get workshops going um as as often as time will allow me and every time I don't have a workshop for a couple of months or whatever I feel this uh emptiness in my heart I'm not connecting with those that really want to to connect with us and do this so um it'll be uh it'll be really good so I'm looking forward to that um I F I fixed some DNS things and all that I and all sorts of stuff on my website which is part of the reason that we've been delaying things but uh now I think we're all um clear to go so um that's it for the announcements really for now um book is selling well continue to um please keep recommending it if you like it and uh we'll just have a better uh place for everyone to work in so uh okay let's start with uh with some of the topics from uh from the community that we've uh come across so um the first one uh we kind of uh we're kind of digging in deeper to something we touched on before which is the expert help but after talking about that you know flipping it back to well what are we helping with uh you know what are the knowledge gaps in uh in event sourcing that tends to uh derail efforts to move to event sourcing right um so we had a quick chat before about this so in terms of uh what people might you know what people might think is good enough to start for a team to do event sourcing how do the knowledge gaps hurt that team what do you think yeah I think so most teams I stop with um they they do not even have knowledge gaps they have no prior experience with event sourcing so most teams do not have any experience and uh many of them try to jump into the cold water and simply TR try to start doing events souring reading a few articles doesn't sound that complicated uh should be fine read watching a few videos and then just go but I think that is most of the time doomed to fail because these these nuances you need to get right at least in a real world project uh it's just too too hard to get right without any experience right I think uh the knowledge gaps are different for different people so uh you know while one person might um understand that uh you know events must be you know really small and uh just the core information the minimum information you need to change the state of the system okay they got that part but they might miss or not be good at the part of where you want to make a whole bunch of these uh you know these green uh these green boxes behind me uh read models right they're still maybe for them they're still stuck and really letting go of dry you know don't repeat yourself from solid or not solid but the better practices or whatever um I I hate mentioning solid because now it's a sludge of Concepts to me strewn together for for old reasons uh but now uh you know someone like uh like that um they they're one thing because that's what they clung on to you know when when they were learning events sourcing and another person on the same team might have the inverse they might be you know quite good at making green boxes um all the time but they're they're they're missing information is um is that uh they make make events that are that are too big they're using events yeah to store redundant information and so they're destroying the benefit of of the events being a source of truth so when people look at the schema of the events when information's in there they start to get confused like okay this also has the same field with the same property why is this here again um you know it might be okay for some things where an event is really a a snapshot I'm saving the record to be this it's fine in some cases but most of the time events are really a very a very reduced version of what's changed and if you lose that then you lose kind of like which event am I going to depend on if I'm repeating an information and another it might not be as clear as to which one came first which one has the you know um repeated information I have to be careful about that so I'm just giving an example of where knowledge gaps on the team that doesn't have expert help you know how that might have a problem you might say that well these people can then be complimentary they can work together and they can help each other truth of the matter is is that they probably don't have time and maybe they're pairing with other people so they're actually in different pairs and they don't know that they have this complimentary skill so even at that point they don't have someone that's experienced to basically notice this and say look Joe you should talk to so and so they they understand that but inversely you have something to tell them because I can see that um so that's where you kind of want the guidance for for these things it's not that these concept like you said these concepts are not hard but what's hard is that people uh don't understand how much of the old things they have to let go so it's not the concept that's hard it's letting go of what was their safety net for so many years and you needed a lot of safety nets for the single model you know spinning the plates The Deco the the the House of Cards you build based on one model where you know there's so many side effects you change something in your system and you cause these whacka old bugs that come up so people are very you know holding on tight to these things that they um that really saved them much more misery in the old way of working so it's and they don't know that they can let go of these things because those are not concerns in an event sourcing uh project so you know these uh these knowledge gaps are are kind of a uh an interesting way of looking at it where where someone might be holding on to dry and someone else might be holding holding on to to something else um in entirely um maybe maybe they maybe they're influenced by Pub sub publish everything all the time so that every everyone can subscribe well in event sourcing that's kind of bad because if you're doing that your events become littered with extraneous information and uh you don't know really what your source of Truth is any thoughts about this type of Gap analysis I think the the big problem with these gaps is it's really hard to overcome them because uh you can read about event design you can read about how to do it right but uh I think you need to do it a few times really handson to really understand what does it actually mean by just reading it and and never applying it h you will never overcome these knowledge gaps I think there's also yeah there's also a sorry go ahead just just apply applying it without someone who has already done this in a few projects is just uh takes a lot of time and requires it will result in a lot of Errors you need to make a lot of Errors to get it right into end so yeah that's probably yeah and uh I think uh it's also the fear of how dropping some of those things you've been holding on to you are not sure if others on your team also have done this or they're also holding on to the same thing so there as you're learning a new way of working um whatever it is you have a fear of um affecting your team negatively as well so if I'm doing event sourcing uh because I'm in a I'm in a team I'm less I have less courage to change things because in the old way of thing of doing things if I was less careful my impact was huge to the team I could set them back I could really put in the blocker I do a refactoring that affects everyone else's work that they've done before they're all going to be mad at me right we don't have this we have the slice by the slice approach so and that again is again like something that you have to experience to gain that that courage you can you know you can read about you know writing a unicycle all you want but until you get on the unicycle and practice it's not going to be good enough and I think this fear of um of affecting other people on the team is kind of similar you have to have gone through working this way with people a few times to get the confidence to say that you know I'm quite happy to focus on my slice and I'm fully confident that if I continue to do this the event model will tell me how things work together and that these contracts are good enough for others to do their work I don't have to worry about what the next person to me is doing on their slice the next pair of people pairing on something or whatever it is however you set up your your organization that's that's another I think with where the knowledge gaps um and the inexperience kind of fold into how people might have a tough time starting with event sourcing again it's not a EV sourcing itself it's just people are not working the way they used to you can't get it for free you can't stop working the old way that doesn't work well without dropping it so this safety net is is a tough one to crack and I think when you have a mix of people different people have different ways where how it manifests to the team so um yeah I think it's also why we continue to work with teams um uh all the time they they come back to us because they they might have uh new people and they just they they already know that their experienced teams have uh have this under control but they don't have the bandwidth to maybe pair with the new people on new teams and so they'll call us back in to kind of do what we did with them for this new team and that really sets them up to not slow down progress on other projects and they know that they have the same help they had before they know what they're getting they're going to get slices it's all events it's all event modeled it's planned nicely and it'll integrate properly they have that confidence um so yeah these knowledge gaps um are are much better um served when you have someone that's experienced with it and especially especially with the slice based approach so in my opinion it's it's not even event sourcing that is the problem but the the slice based approach thinking in slices and really experiencing it like oh if I build this slice and this thing stays stable it won't change uh you need to see this life to to really understand it you can read my book you can take the course it will not help you need to do it and then you will see it yeah you need to get that confidence of of seeing others work around you um around this way of working as you yourself are adopting this new way of working you need to see that others around you experiencing the same thing that this beautiful while we're being entirely collaborative about the whole process the autonomy you have for your own work your the the peace of mind that what you you do is not going to destroy someone else's progress is amazing so the slice way of working is I would I can't think of a better way of of doing things so we also have some more topics that touch on this uh um this way of thinking and how it unlocks some of these ways we're thinking of complexity so um let's jump on to the second topic then so unless you have any more to add Martin a good one okay good to end on that note for this um so the next we have uh so this keeps coming back because I think the um the industry at least distributed systems event driven systems have this Saga pattern it just rears its uh ugly head over and over again and uh sometimes it's not talked about I mean people are generally getting help by reading about sagas um and they're they stopped using the word but they're still talking about processors and they're still talking about um the algorithms within the processor the decision trees within the processor instead of looking at information flow so I'm just gonna let's discuss this after I say what the situation is so we have so we have this this idea that someone has an idea of a traditional process I have to start this thing and it'll get the price of a stock and then it'll do the next thing how does one processor do this key is it's not one processor and the reason that people think it's one processor is because of this idea that's been propagated with process managers AKA sagas in this distributed thing that a saga is an entity and I think it's very uh it's lumping a lot of complexity into one thing which is not good and so I think one of the best patterns to think about talking about the Saga pattern and actually I should say template to to kind of unwind The Saga so if you're doing event modeling and no sagas in it and you want to implement what you traditionally had as one giant process manager or saga or something think of um every step that your processor or saga has to do is just a column on a to-do list right and you have this table with these rows of different things getting finished bit by bit uh one thing at a time and if it's a stock purchase you have to acquire a current price to even put in a an order that makes sense you might want to you know query the order book itself to see what the bid and ask is and all that kind of stuff that's like well that's your API call to get data so that you can do something well that is a separate step I think a lot of people lump this in as one yeah exctly where like well I just have this procedure where at this point in the code it makes this API call to get the price and it continues bad way of thinking about it it's about what is the state that you're going through you have a state where it knows nothing you only know what you want to do right that is the coordinator that's the first step that's a separate processor to coordinate now the second step is to okay which things do I need to get prices for okay these things that's a second processor to do that now you can go back to the original processor on the once the prices were filled in to those columns you can go and have that original processor now you know call uh the apis to put on the orders at the different Exchange at the prices based on the prices you just got from the previous processor and that can include your SLA I mean that can include time stamps so that if that processor was late getting the results back you know they're stale because they're more than 10 seconds old or whatever your SLA is and and then uh you have to maybe repeat it you know maybe the that one column in that to-do list is a you know needs to retry and it's number two on the retry right or the first retry or what ever um and so you have these business rules that are spread out to how you move through the process it's no longer a procedure with some API call in the middle going back and doing the same thing you literally want to decompose that procedural function um into how can I in have this Integrity if I pull the plug along this uh anywhere along my traditional logic line if I pull the plug from the server and I plug it back in and it goes back online how is this going to continue so this mentality of just having you know one Ledger with a whole bunch of you know that's what we call them to-do lists because it's really like in order for me to fulfill this I have to do a lookup I have to do X I have to do y I have to do Zed and then I can do what I was wanting to do originally all of those can be translated into columns in one row for that entire process that's all you need a saga is unnecessary complexity you just have one row saying what you got what you don't have you have a coordinator you have processors that Co that basically are are lock in step with each of those columns along the way that is your Saga there's no need to call it a saga there's no need to have an extra entity to deal with it it's really just another green box that feeds one or more processors that do one thing and one thing only so stop thinking of a process or or functions as being this complicated list of steps with this procedure you you split them up onto individual pieces and it's kind of like the Unix philosophy one tool that does job well you have the coordinators say these are the steps that we want to coordinate going through I have something that fetches the price that's all it does just fetches the price maybe you have one thing that fetches the price from the New York Stock Exchange then you have one from the hang and you have one from the German Stock Exchange they're built for those apis that's all they do they don't need to have a big if statement for what they do for for each one you can you know you you can tend to them as you wish and then not only that but you have the results coordinated in a simple record a simple row in a database table will do and that's it so I I think that's what I wanted to say what are your thoughts on this when you when you when you model this so I think the I think what we need here is really a a few more examples which are a little bit more complex you posted one this morning in Discord and I think this this will really help so when you model something like this would it be several processes connected to the same to-do list or how would you model that yeah I think a lot of times maybe what what scares people from the Simplicity of one step only in an event model is that they have to now make a whole bunch of green boxes for something that's a saga and that's actually the opposite The Saga is one green box with you know where a row represents a whole bunch of things so it's actually quite um quite the opposite um but I think what people have a problem with is that they can attach multiple processors to that same to-do list because a lot of times there's this oh you know if I'm automate if I'm just automating one thing then yes the green box the to-do list only is attached to One processor does one thing yeah but really um even if you call it the same processor and it's doing different things it's really separate processors because coordinating whether I'm going to buy a stock or not is a different process than just fetching the data for the current price and maybe the order book status yeah um right and and the records there so so I think when people want to think of sagas and more complex things that they're automating is that they should say do I have a place where a row in the table tells me where I'm at for any of these things that have to happen you know that is the simplest way to start and yes you will get into more complex things or was like way longer things but then you can break them up into you know sub sagas or sub you know coordinations or multiple multiple to-do lists like I think once you get into like you know 10 columns in your in your to-do list of you know 10 different things that have to get accomplished or nine or whatever you might start to think that I kind of need another workflow to be cut off at some point and it's very easy to to glue those together because you can say phase one ended successfully phase two starts with whatever the projection is from that so all of these things are just coordinating information moving through a system there is no magic kind of one single pattern to to do all this it's really about coordinating what information do I need when did I get into the system can I make a decision based on that system now if so yes then pass it on to the next set of steps outside of this one automation this one long sort of uh workflow process so I always call them workflow process processes um and these to-do lists really kind of identify what that is so yeah we need more more examples I think I think the stock market is a good one because that has a lot of like slas in there um you kind of have to understand when you got information ass system to understand how stale it is because that stock market stuff is so time sensitive that it doesn't matter if you're doing sync async or or if it's in process like what the implementation is you always have to say you know how how stale is this information and and that does not escape the um any kind of implementation there's no implementation that'll give you uh you know something that says that this is now there's no now every time you're looking at information in stale it's just how stale are you're willing to tolerate it to be so I don't know what other topics I mean what other examples would be good I think we have these these other ones that we've used traditionally like booking trips when you have a flight a car rental and whatever I think that's another one um there there's definitely you can come up with thousands from from different things but yeah definitely we could we could work on some other ones and you know that thing that I had on Discord you know I just drew that in you know five minutes it wasn't didn't take me long at all to to show the concept so once you understand it these are not like magical formulas that are super hard to do that it's about dropping the old way of thinking and just saying what do I have in the system at this point in terms of information and letting go of the implementation once you let go that this must be an API call in the middle of a long procedure that I'm writing because that's the way I've done things before and I use ioc containers and dependency injection to have a mock of the service all that garbage goes out the window just like what information do I have in the system at any point in time can I go on to the next step with this information that's it um the implementation may be whatever you want but I'm always dividing it up to command Handler command Handler after command Handler um you know processors that are feeding these uh these previous uh you know States into uh potentially some of that information into the commands and it's just the same patterns over and over again um so I think another yeah I think it's really we're leading on to another topic so I'm gonna stop I think what what is really helpful is just thinking about it as this just as this one table where you maybe only have a status flag and the status flag triggers uh one or more processors so you have several processors basically working on this to-do list depending on the state of the to-do list that is something I think we haven't discussed this a lot that this is possible yeah it could be a Boolean as this is done or not for the simplest case but for the uh processor of purchasing the stock or kicking off a specific job that you get from somewhere else um I you know you could have three states so I have okay price uh wait so waiting for price so the processor that fetches the price from the stock exchange comes back once it does that it says waiting for execution right and then the other processor goes and calls to make the order and then that that same field gets changed to done as the last thing completes and so now the original processor no longer picks up that job because it's finished so yes you can have Boolean but when you have these things starting to add more steps and those The Telltale sign is like well I need to make an API call to get more information to complete this well there's your clue you're getting more information from an external source that is another step that's another and that's another you know it it's it's another uh it's not just Boolean now you've added like do I have this or the other and if it becomes more complex like you have to have multiple Fields filled in from external sources you no longer have just one two or three states for one column you might have have five columns each with a Boolean inside so it's really up to you how you organize this but it's like you said it's just at the core it's like was this done yet if yes maybe populate the information in that field instead of null it could be a Boolean done or not it's up to you yeah I'm pretty sure that uh many people who listen to this now have an aha moment because I really think we we haven't discussed this in detail a lot so um that might be pretty interesting yeah I think a lot of maybe we should have uh a lot more uh focus on this because this is uh this is something that unlocked event sourcing for me a long time ago um was really understanding how powerful the projection of past events is and how to track progress through things that are non-trivial yeah and so um and the problem with uh with all of the hello world projects out there is they really don't have a lot of external API calls um at least the ones we've been doing around event sourcing it's about the shopping cart and things like that um and when you start to look at the influx of information from external systems and how you coordinate what you have what you don't have you start to get to just seeing how the processors are highly interchangeable with what humans do with the UI and for me that was an AA moment many years ago um where I still I personally felt forced to think about sagas and like oh sagas are a good thing um I'm going to continue to think about the um Diner example of the same slip of paper going from taking the order to paying for everything but that started to lose its Effectiveness along the way somewhere where I really needed um to have maybe you know smaller pieces of information along the way and pass uh coordination from one to-do list that was large to another one that's when I started this to see that okay there's a there's a fundamental simplicity at work here um I need to actually drop the idea of the um you know the the diner and and the single piece of paper for the order that ends up being the receipt at the end that's a good place to start but I think you have to move from there to really evolve um that you have true freedom of you know making new pieces of paper or whatever in your workflow and uh and and that yeah it's hard to explain so we have to have more examples examples yeah we need examples I'm really thinking about adding so the example I have in the book I have a chapter r a to-do list and the example isn't good uh I realized this by now I might be reworking this with a with a bigger and a more complicated example just to Showcase what is possible with this pattern yeah I mean one that I'd like to see probably would be the um um acquiring stock yeah you know because you do have to do an external lookup and and um yeah so I think uh I think having data come in and pushing data out for a payment um and uh com combining these would be a really good non-trivial example that yeah maybe do both maybe have the simple one and then have a non-trivial one so that people see people see the spectrum of uh you know where you can end up in terms of what you're solving so um yeah I think that's uh so yeah sagas just to wrap it up I think if you're in the world of creating um this concept of a of a long running workflow with multiple steps and you think you're going to have a crazy class to contain it all some aggregate to contain it all replace all that with one record in your database that has a column for each for each step and if it's been done or not and if it's been done what the data it got back is if it's necessary and uh and then have multiple of these little uh boxes that I have about me sorry these gears just have lot of those little guys and uh they will pick up each of those they'll they'll they'll basically be triggered by the change in status of of any of those columns and in a onetoone mapping with those columns I think that's one of the easiest ways to kind of think about it and and that way you don't have this idea that you know one to-do list is One processor it's if the one to-do list has multiple columns then that has multiple processors I think it's easier to describe it like that so that's how I kind of want to end that I don't know if you want to add anything to that and uh when you when you implement this I know exactly the question that will come up next so um when you implement this does only the coordination processor updated to do list or does every processor updated to- do list and the the next question that will come up is uh do they write directly to the database or do they populated only by events yeah it's it's by events and they're responsible for the updating the columns so the that's why the to-do list row is the coordinator because you have these um all these different processors uh working off of that so while you can have the coordinator you know set up all the default values for these multiple columns um each of those other processors get uh look at that every five seconds or if you have it on a reactive kind of scheme um they get past this change as a record directly and they see that hey this column is something I care about it's not done yet that's my job I'm going to go send this command get the data back and then I'm going to populate it and then next time I'm invoked I notice that these records already have something and I don't have to worry about them exactly but yeah you know those are that's how I would do it and yeah important questions to ask yourself and um you know we're seeing a lot of experienced people like really really smart people on the Discord asking these questions um um really the old experience is getting in the way they're really smart they're really good at doing traditional stuff but then um it's like a a mental block to move to this way of uh of just catching the data and saying I'm done really having that modularity for the workflow to be thought of this way but anyway that's it's very it's it's a very cool feeling when you get it and let go and I think it's the letting go that's that's so hard for people to do I'm really seeing it it took really smart people that I'm seeing posting these problems I'm like wow I can I can relate to that because it took me ages to get it really really really long yeah yeah um so so no we can't blame anyone it just takes time to get it right so if you're if you're listening to this and you have a lot of experience it's it's changing the way you work can be very humbling to yourself yeah we've both experienced that right um and that's how you that's how you grow in in uh in your experience in your career your knowledge is really um freeing yourself from a lot of things that seemed like a good idea at the time um are no are really holding you back so yeah it's it's tough
